# NetMirror - A Modern Looking-glass Server

NetMirror is a modern, feature-rich looking-glass server with a beautiful web interface for network diagnostics and performance testing.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Modern UI**: A clean and responsive user interface built with Vue.js.
- **Network Tools**: A suite of tools including Ping, iPerf3, and Speedtest.
- **Real-time Traffic**: Live monitoring of network interface traffic.
- **Interactive Shell**: A fake shell environment for basic diagnostics.
- **Easy Deployment**: Ships as a single Docker container.
- **Customizable**: Configure features and server details via environment variables.

## üöÄ Quick Start (Docker Compose)

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Yuri-NagaSaki/NetMirror.git
    cd NetMirror
    ```

2.  **Create an environment file:**

    Copy the example environment file to create your own configuration.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    *Note: If `.env.example` does not exist, you can create a blank `.env` file and add the variables you need from the table below.*

3.  **Customize your configuration (optional):**

    Edit the `.env` file to set your server location, public IP addresses, and other options.

4.  **Start the server:**
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

The application will be accessible at `http://<your-server-ip>`. The default port is 3000, which can be changed via the `HTTP_PORT` environment variable.

Configure NetMirror by setting environment variables in the `.env` file.
